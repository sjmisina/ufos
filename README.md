# The Truth is Out There - UFOs
<b>Are we alone in the universe? For millennia, humans have turned to the sky to answer this question. Now, thanks to research generously funded by W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist, we can supplement our sky-searching with data analysis.</b>

## Project Overview  
We have created a landing page where you can dig through the data funded and provided by W. Avy. As a user you can browse the entire dataset, or filter it by Country, State, City, Date, and even the Shape of the anomoly. The results are presented with the duration of the event and even comments from the witnesses.  

Are we alone? Consider these encounters ...

## Results  
Navigation of this site is intentionally simple, so anyone can use this resource. There are five filter fields:

- The date filter is looking for an exact match in the database; therefore, no leading zeros should be included for the month or day.
- The database provided is for the first weeks of January 2010. Do not enter a date later than 1/13/2010 to return results.
- The filters are looking for exact matches, e.g., capitalization or misspellings will cause compromised results.
- The results are filtered every time the user presses <kbd>RETURN/ENTER</kbd>.
